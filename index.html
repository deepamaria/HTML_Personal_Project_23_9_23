        Over the past 4 years, I have dedicated myself in upskilling and gaining practical experience in the IT field. Presently, I am pursuing a full time course in Front End Development from ReDI School Munich and together with that I have got an opportunity to work with Redi-Lab as part of developing a dynamic responsive website project and in hosting it in Cloud for the client Reclaim Berlin. Here, we work as an Agile Team to achieve the goal within the target date. Additionally, I have pursued courses in Infrastructure Basics and Cloud Computing from ReDI School of Digital Integration Germany.

    <p>
        After the completion of post-graduation in the year 2012, I have worked as assistant professor in engineering college for 6 years. I had different tasks like lecturing different topics of computer science, teaching different programming languages like C, C++, Java, Database management and also had to deal with practical sessions in these programming languages. While teaching has been a fulfilling and enriching experience, I have always been drawn to the world of technology and software development. I have gained strong analytical and problem-solving skills during my experience as a project mentor for my young engineering aspirants. I am confident that my passion towards the company and dedication to continuous learning make me a strong candidate for this role. As an experienced educator with a background in lecturing different computer science engineering subjects, I have developed exceptional communication and interpersonal skills.
